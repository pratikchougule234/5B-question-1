            CSK has good winning probability. But this time all players in KKR are performing wll so thinking about winner 
            is difficult.

        <p>IPL 2021 was another heartbreak for Royal Challengers Bangalore and their fans. RCB were defeated by the Kolkata Knight Riders by four wickets in the Eliminator. RCB played some very good cricket in the first-half of IPL 2021 and won four out of the seven games in the UAE leg, finishing up in third position.
        RCB skipper Virat Kohli, before the start of the UAE leg, announced that this will be his last season as RCB skipper. Now that the asonis over for the Bangalore boys, Virat Kohli has stepped down as the captain of the franchise and RCB will be looking for someone who canlead the team from the next IPL.</p>
